**Simple Keylogger**

First, you need to install the pynput library. You can do this using pip:
_pip install pynput_

Save this code to a file named keylogger.py. When you run the script, it will start logging keystrokes and save them to a file named keystrokes.txt.

To stop the keylogger, simply close the script's console window. The keystrokes.txt file will contain the recorded keystrokes.

Note: Keyloggers can be used maliciously to record sensitive data like passwords and credit card numbers. This example is for educational purposes only. Misuse of this code is strictly discouraged. Always respect privacy and obtain consent before using any form of data collection or monitoring.
